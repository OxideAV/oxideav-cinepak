# oxideav-cinepak

Pure-Rust Cinepak (CVID) video decoder for the
[oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace) framework.

## Status

**Round 1 — clean-room rebuild from `docs/video/cinepak/spec/`.** The
prior implementation was retired by the OxideAV docs audit dated
2026-05-06; the rebuild replaces it from public reverse-engineering
references (multimedia.cx wiki, Tim Ferguson's `videocodec/cinepak.txt`,
US patent 5,467,413, behavioural observation of system FFmpeg as a
black-box CLI). FFmpeg source is not consulted at any phase.

The previous on-disk history is preserved on the `old` branch; it is
**not** an input for this rebuild.

## What's implemented

Decode side, end-to-end:

- 10-byte frame header (`flags`, 24-bit `frame_length`, `width`,
  `height`, `strip_count`).
- 12-byte strip header with Y-coordinate sentinel rule for
  multi-strip frames.
- Full and selective codebook chunks for both V4 (12-bit YUV) and V1,
  plus the 8-bit grayscale variants
  (`0x2000` / `0x2100` / `0x2200` / `0x2300` /
  `0x2400` / `0x2500` / `0x2600` / `0x2700`).
- Vector chunks `0x3200` (V1-only intra), `0x3000` (mixed V1/V4 intra),
  `0x3100` (inter with skip codes — handles selector-bit spillover
  across flag-word boundaries).
- V1 quadrant macroblock expansion, V4 sub-block macroblock expansion.
- Codebook inheritance across strips and across frames (header-only
  chunk = "reuse previous codebook").
- YUV → RGB conversion with truncation-toward-zero on `U / 2` and
  per-channel clamp to `[0, 255]`.
- Skip macroblocks copy 4×4 blocks from the previous frame's
  reconstructed buffer.

## Output pixel formats

- `Rgb24` — 12-bit YUV streams converted via the spec's inverse
  matrix.
- `Gray8` — 8-bit luminance-only streams (chunk family `0x24xx`/`0x26xx`).

## FourCCs registered

`CVID` (AVI `biCompression`, QuickTime `cvid` codec tag, Sega FILM
`cvid` — all upper-cased through `CodecTag::fourcc`).

## Standalone vs registry-integrated

The default `registry` cargo feature wires the crate into
`oxideav-core` (Decoder trait, `register(ctx)` entry point). Disable
the feature for an `oxideav-core`-free build that exposes only the
crate-local `CinepakDecoder`, `CinepakFrame`, `CinepakPixelFormat`,
and `CinepakError` types.
